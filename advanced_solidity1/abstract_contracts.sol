ABSTRACT CONTRACTS

Abstract Contract is one which contains at least one function without any implementation
Such as contract is used  as a base contract 
Generally an abstract contract contains both implemented as well as abstract functions 
Derived contract will implement the abstract function  and use the existing functions as and when required

base contract vs derived contract
then we have information in that base contract that gets passed along in a derived contract
= contract that inherits from the base contract

EXO

1. Create an abstract base contract called Calculator with a read only public function that returns integers
2. Create a derived contract called Test which derives the Calculator contract and can calculate 1 + 2 and returns the result
